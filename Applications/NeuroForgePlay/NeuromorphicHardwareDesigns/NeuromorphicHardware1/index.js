    setTimeout(() => {Here's an example of how you can structure your NeuroForgePlay application using React Native. I've created a basic structure for you, with some example simulations and hardware designs.

First, let's create the main `NeuroForgePlay` component. This component will contain all the other components related to simulations and hardware designs.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import SimulationExperiments from './SimulationExperiments/index';
import CognitiveComputingAlgorithms from './Cognitive_Computing_Algorithms/index';
import BrainInspiredArchitectures from './Brain_Inspired_Architectures/index';

const NeuroForgePlay = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <SimulationExperiments />
      <CognitiveComputingAlgorithms />
      <BrainInspiredArchitectures />
    </View>
  );
};

export default NeuroForgePlay;
